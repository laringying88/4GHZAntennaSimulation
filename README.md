Abstractâ€”In response to the complex requirements of the application environment, an omnidirectional microstrip monopole antenna in S/C band is designed using a combination of printed circuit board and radiating oscillator to achieve a standing wave ratio (VSWR) of less than 2 between 3.45GHz and 4.75GHz, which features a monopole E-plane pattern, a variation range of gain from 0.2 to 2.5dBi and good omnidirectionality. In this paper, a monopole application antenna is designed for this purpose by full wave and circuit simulation to find out the optimum parameters, and practical measurements and support are obtained to design an omnidirectional antenna with good performance that meets the requirements. Because it has the advantages of electrically small size and flexibility to conform to the conducting cylinder with small radius, it should be very attractive for many miniaturized robots in the future.
